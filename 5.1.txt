#A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them. These items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows

#The term "database schema" can refer to a visual representation of a database, a set of rules that govern a database,
# or to the entire set of objects belonging to a particular user.

#Question 2:

# BRAND - Must be string, cannot be NULL, and we cannot have the same value more than one time in our DB.
# YEAR - Must be integer, cannot be NULL
# PRICE - Must be integer, can be also floating number.
# The table's PRIMARY KEY is the ID column, when Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.
# The table can have only ONE primary key

# B.This command inserting new values to an existing CUSTOMERS table.
